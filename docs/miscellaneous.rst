Miscellaneous
=============

Occasionally, I might create a function or class that I think is worth others knowing about that isn't directly related to ListView filters. Those will be documented here.

Generally, these will be used by the package, so I haven't split them out into a 'standalone' package.

get_settings
------------

A simple function that makes it easy to overwrite class (or other) variables with a Django project settings variable, if it exists.
